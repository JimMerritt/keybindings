# Keybindings

Personal project to show the Adobe Suite keybindings in an interactive, responsive layout. Built using Jekyll.

## Notes:

### JavaScript for keyboards
  03-29-16: After looking for multiple ways to change the background color of keys based on the user input, one surefire way
  is to trigger link every key with a corresponding id from the dom. This may not be the best way, but it seems to work and will
  do for now.
